This film deeply portrays every little detail and hardships of the teaching profession. It’s not just a story about one teacher but a mirror reflecting the dedication and perseverance of every teacher. We hope that through this film, we can pay the highest respect to all teachers silently working in education, sparking greater awareness and respect for education and teachers, and together, rekindling the passion and dignity of teachers before it’s too late.",0.2373,/rJTMifPmfQZhlrZVBx2lToiBO5G.jpg,2025-03-28,Mr. Eternal Jellyfish,False,0.0,0
